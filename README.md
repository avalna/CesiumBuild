# CesiumBuild
The UI/UX is some what inspired from the Origo Map project <br>
This is a test build <br>
Current tools and functions in this build: sun study, get coordinates on click, tree placement, share location, print the viewer. <br>
Share location is working in my main model but not this one. Collape layers, turn off layers and search does not work since they are wms related and the wms layer list is removed for this build.
